# Rootless Pixel Launcher
## Amir Zaidi (@azaidi at XDA)

### Features

- Icon packs
- Swipe up/down for notifications
- 6x6 grid for low DPI
- Center popups for high DPI
- No adaptive background for pre-Oreo apps

### Reverting

Disable this launcher and switch to different launcher before disabling the module. Not doing so could result in a â€œ0.0dip has stopped working" bug. If you do encounter this bug, try installing the real Pixel Launcher from the app store.

### Bug reports

If something crashes I will need a logcat, a screen recording, a step by step walkthrough of how to reproduce the bug and a comparison with how it works on the real Pixel Launcher.
